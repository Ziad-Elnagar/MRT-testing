first of all, the main issue i faced was that it was my first time using GetHub i searched a lot to know how to deal with it.
the second issue : i was sufering with the command (git status) because the files were already existed but i didn't know how until i realised that it must be included with any file such as an image.i faced a problem when merging that i used the github markdown tool to edit md file and forgot to pull the file to my local and then i did the merge task and tried to push it the cmder gave me rejection and i had to pull the changes from server first but it didnot work then i searched for a solution and changed pull rebase configrations then used the commands and all worked well
